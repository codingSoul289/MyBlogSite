	<h3>জাগো, তুমি জাগো - A view into the Labyrinth of Pandals of Durga Puja 2021</h3>
	<p id="Date">October 16, 2021</p>
	<p><br>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; <strong>A</strong>fter what seemed like ages, here we are at the window of celebrations, a juxtaposition of contrasting themes, a phalanx of hand-made creative art forms of humanoid gods and goddesses, a period when almost every Bengali, irrespective of religion, caste or creed, eschews all relations with their daily and monotonous life cycle to embrace the occasion of Maa Durga descending from the heavens to visit her paternal abode - Yes, we are at the horizon of the 2021 Durga Puja vacations. In retrospect, just a few months ago, we were in the midst of the deadly and appalling second wave of COVID-19, the pandemic which roots back to the month of March, 2020, when it shook the entire world with its repercussions and long-lasting consequences. The first wave had dwindled down to around 9000-12000 cases per day in India, around the months of January and February, 2021. Every person living in the country saw some hope, a light at the end of the tunnel. It was at this point that the second wave had planted its ferocious seeds, and gnawed away at almost every household. Around a few million cases had been noted with many turning fatal, exhibiting a horrifying event in the history of the Indian civilisation. Though the second wave had started to dwindle down in the months of August and September, it didn't fully disappear. West Bengal itself had envisioned a spectacle she never wishes to be repeated again. We needed some relief, a period of forgetting the past, the present and the future, boycotting the concept of time itself, to breathe in some ounce of life. Ergo, this year's Durga Puja was a cause of replenishment more than any other year, it was an event that almost every Bengali wished to absorb forever in their veins and arteries, to learn to move on from the deadly times towards a brighter day ahead. Yes, the period from 6th October till 15th October (and even further for some) was a period of rebirth for us - to gain the energy and zeal for presenting ourselves at the helm of life again. </p>
